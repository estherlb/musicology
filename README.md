# week 1
For this course, I want to work with spotify's "Movie Soundtrack Best of" playlist. Like the title says, this playlist contains soundtrack from different movies. There are 205 songs in the playlist. Some songs group together to one movie, and some songs are the only ones that represent a movie in the playlist. That all the songs come from a movie, does not mean they sound the same. Most of the songs contain no vocal sounds, but some songs are atypical for the playlist and have a very loud voice. Some songs are very upbeat and sound very positive and some songs would have probably played during a sad scene in the movie. 
This playlist has a lot of different movies, but most of them are more or less the same genre. I will maybe in the future add some other soundtracks to make the playlist somewhat more diverse. I see a lot of adventure/fantasy feel good movies, to make a representative dataset it is important to have other genres as well. Also, there are some movie saga's, the playlist contains a lot of Harry Potter songs for example.
For this course, I would like to compare the music that I like to the movie soundtrack playlist, and see what movie compares best to my music and if my music taste is the same as my movie taste. I would also like to find out if the same movie genres have the same kind of music.
